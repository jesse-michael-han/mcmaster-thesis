In this thesis, we consider the problem of capturing finite-representability between Banach spaces using the tools of continuous model theory. We introduce predicates and additional sorts to capture finite-representability and show that these can be used to expand the language of Banach spaces. We then show that the class of infinite-dimensional Banach spaces expanded with this additional structure forms an elementary class $\mathcal{K}_G$, and conclude that the theory $T_G$ of $K_G$ is interpretable in $T^{eq}$, where $T$ is the theory of infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. Finally, we show that existential equivalence in a reduct of the language implies finite-representability. Relevant background on continuous model theory and Banach space theory is provided.
