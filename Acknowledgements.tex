First, I would like to thank my supervisor, Bradd Hart, for his patient mentorship and guidance of this work. I would also like to thank Michael Makkai for his suggestions, stimulating discussions, an impromptu mini-course in FOLDS, unearthing various unpublished manuscripts, and for his hospitality when I visited McGill. I am especially grateful to Bill Boshuck for inviting me into his home and for the generosity with which he shared his time, expertise, and espresso while I was in Montreal.

I would also like to thank: Christian Espindola for bumping into me in Stockholm and for many stimulating conversations thereafter; Nate Ackerman and Will Boney for their hospitality,  suggestions, and helpful conversation while I visited Harvard, Steven Lazzaro for introducing me to Benihana and attempting to keep me humble, Deirdre Haskell for patiently sharing her expertise on valued fields, and anybody else who I failed to mention, but should have.
