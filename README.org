#+TITLE: Reconstruction problems for first-order theories

This is my master's thesis.

The [[https://github.com/jesse-michael-han/theories-interpretations-pretoposes][theories and interpretations]] draft was written as a revised Chapter 1 of this thesis. It might be merged into the main document at some point.

To read the thesis, either compile it with pdfLaTeX or look at [[./main.pdf][main.pdf]]
